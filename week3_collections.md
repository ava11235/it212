The Java collections framework represents a group of objects such as the ArrayList or LinkedList and provides the architecture
to work with these objects without a need to know their implementation details.
This results in programming efficines, since the programmer need not be concerned with implementing the data structures or underlying algorithms.
The standard view allows for code reuse.
