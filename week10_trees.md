### Trees

![Binary Tree](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f7/Binary_tree.svg)

A Tree is a directed (has one-way links between nodes) and acyclic  (no path wraps back around to the same node twice) structure of linked nodes.

Using a recursive definition, a tree is either 
empty (null)

OR

has a root node that contains: data, a left subtree, and a right subtree.

The left and/or right subtree can be empty.

A binary tree is one where each node has no more than two children.

Tree node: an object containing data and a left and right node children.

Root: the top node of the tree.

Leaf: A node without children.

Branch: any node that is neither the roof nor a leaf.

Tree height: the length of the longest path from root to a node.

Tree applications Organizational charts, directories and files on a computer, AI decision trees. 

The Java Collections framework has a TreeMap and TreeSet implementations.

Binary Trees average time complexity of Binary Trees for access/search and insert/delete is O(log(n).
