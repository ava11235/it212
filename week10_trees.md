### Trees

![Binary Tree](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f7/Binary_tree.svg)

A Tree is a directed (has one-way links between nodes) and acyclic(no path wraps back around to the same node twice) structure of linked nodes.

Using a recursive definition, a tree is either 
empty (null)

OR

has a root node that contains: data, a left subtree, and a right subtree.

The left and/or right subtree can be empty.

A binary tree is one where each node has no more than two children.
