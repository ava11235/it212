### ADTs

An abstract data type (ADT) is a data type which defines operations for the type without specifying the implementaiton details.

### List ADT
A list is an ADT describing operations for ordered data, such as append, remove, search or print the list.

A singly-linked list is a data structure  implementing a list ADT. A linked list has nodes, where each node has data and a pointer to the next node.

The first node is called a head. The last node is called the tail.tailA singly-linked list's first node is called the head, and the last node the tail. 

In a singly-linked list each element contains a point to the next and/or previous element in the list.

In a doubly-linked list each node has data, a pointer to the next node, and a pointer to the previous node.

### Stack ADT

A stack is a last in, first out (LIFO) ADT in which items can  only be inserted on or removed from the top of a stack. e.g. A stack of plates in the cafeteria.
Common operations on a stack are push: insert item on the top and pop, remove and return item on the top.

### Queue ADT 

A queue is a first in, first out (FIFO) ADT in which items are inserted at the end  and removed from the front of the queue. e.g. A line in the cafeteria. 
Common queue operations are enqueue:  insert an item at the end of the queue, and dequeue:  remove and return the item at the front of the queue.
